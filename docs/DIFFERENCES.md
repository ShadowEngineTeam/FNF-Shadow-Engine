## Differences Between The Original
- Uses our haxelib forks for backporting and fixing stuff
- Uses latest Haxe
- Uses [ANGLE](https://github.com/google/angle) to run Shadow Engine inside [Vulkan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulkan)<br>(Also possibly fixing black boxes in low end? ([with a hack](https://github.com/FNF-SE/angle-build-modified/blob/main/patches/0001-Bend-ANGLE-rules-for-MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE-unconditionally.patch)))
- Uses our UI (ShadowUI) similar to PsychUI in 1.0
- Uses some code from [P-Slice](https://github.com/Psych-Slice/P-Slice), [Leather Engine (R.I.P.)](https://github.com/Vortex2Oblivion/LeatherEngine), [Codename Engine](https://github.com/CodenameCrew/CodenameEngine)
- Replaced [`flxanimate`](https://github.com/Dot-Stuff/flxanimate) with [`flixel-animate`](https://github.com/MaybeMaru/flixel-animate) for better performance for texture atlases
- Replaced [`hxCodec`](https://github.com/polybiusproxy/hxCodec) with [`hxvlc`](https://github.com/FNF-SE/hxvlc) for better customizability in video cutscenes
- Mobile Support (duh)
- Applies OpenAL Soft Config For better audio
- Slightly more accurate FPS and less RAM Usage
- Unironically winning icons support

- Kade Engine Results Screen
- PlayState has `changeNoteSkin` for easy in-game note skin changing
- Play as Opponent
- Stripped to only have Test song and some characters<br>(TBD to re-add, see [TODO](../todo/TODO.md))
- Kade Engine Note Timing (man I feel old), VSync and Pop Up Score Option
- Includes all classes as possible into source
- Scriptable States Support!! (ig idk honestly if I [Homura] did good job)
